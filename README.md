#Self-tightening Shoes

##I wanted to develop a kind of shoes that ties the laces itself whenever you put your foot in one of them. How it makes is that, there is a chip that I am designing to sense and recognize the tightness of different kinds of foot when put into the shoe. The chip is placed under the shoe pad and between the pad and sole of a shoe. Once you put your foot into the shoe, it covers up and presses against the layer of the shoe pad. The chip receives a signal and tighten the shoe by itself.

##For testing, the shoes should be able to detect and receive a signal whenever they are worn. Once is ready, the user is going to press on a button on the side of the shoe (left side on left shoe, right on the right shoe). As the buttons are pressed on each side, shoes will be receiving a signal to tighten up the shoes with the custom tightness you have set.

##Steps:

###1. I am going to design a customizing program on Thonny for the shoes to set up each level of tightness of the shoes. From scale of 1-10 (loose to tight). I am going to use the "range", "try" and "except" concepts.

###2. I am going to design an operation for the shoes to be turned on/off. It is going to be a long-press to the button in order to turn on the shoes or shut them down. (Once the shoes are turned on, the tightness will be automatically switched to level 1. The shoes will be opened up entirely once the shoes are turned off.)

##Revisions:

###I have completed for the first step so far, and it is going pretty much as what I planned. The shoes are basically able to set the tightness according to the number I put in.
